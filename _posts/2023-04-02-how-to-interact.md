This website displays different elements of a project that analyses a kinesiology experiment, including video analysis, excel analysis, and graphic development. Navigate with the navigation bar at the top right. I recommended starting by exploring the Experiment Background page, then within Project Elements choose the Graphic Development, followed by the Video Analysis tab, and finally Excel Analysis. Enjoy!
