This website displays different elements of a project that analyses a kinesiology experiment, including video analysis, excel analysis, and graphic development. Navigate with the navigation bar at the top right (three lines). I recommended to starting by exploring the Experiment Background page, followed by the Video Analysis tab, then Excel Analysis, and finally Graphic Developement. Enjoy!
