During this experiments, participants skied on a ski ergometer to three different speeds for two minutes each. They stood on a force plate that collected normal force and parallel force data, the ski ergometer collected power and the trials were recorded to analyse hip drop timing. 

Matlab was used to generate force curves and to analyse the force and power data Kinovea was used to obtain timing of hand drop, hip drop, hip cessation and hand cessation. Excel was used to generate bar graphs, normalize impulses and power, and to obtain relative hip drop timing.
