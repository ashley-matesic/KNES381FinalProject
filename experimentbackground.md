The participants are informed of trial procedure, they completed the PARQ+ questionnaire, and were given a chance to ask questions. The skier stood 12-24 inches from the flywheel of the ski ergometer. Exact distance was determined based on where the participant achieves an approximate 90-degree bend in their arms when their hands are at eye level. The participants had four minutes to self-direct their warmup on the ski ergometer, they were be instructed to gradually increase effort until they felt ready for the testing. The skier performed three trials of many double poling cycles following the tempo of a metronome that was set to 30, 50, and 70 cycles per minute. The participants performed each trial for 2 minutes with a 3-minute rest period in between trials to prevent fatigue. The participant had time to adjust their pace to the metronome before data was collected. 

Following data collection, video analysis was performed using Kinovea software to track the timing of hip drop, hand drop, hip cessation and hand cessation, which were then plotted with the force curves. A custom script was written on MATLAB to obtain the performance markers for each trial such as mean power normalized to bodyweight and normal and parallel force impulses normalized to body weight. Excel was also used to generate bar graphs, to normalize impulses and power, and to obtain relative hip drop timing.
