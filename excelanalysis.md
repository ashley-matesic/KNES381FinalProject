For this project, Excel was used to keep track of the key time points obtained during video analysis. This can be seen on a sample spreadsheet of a participant, follow along [here](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvXJ6M2Wl3faglxvnmtcSAORzs8Q). The relative initiation of the hip drop to hand drop was calculated for each cycle by subtracting hand drop time from the hip drop time, the same was performed for cessation of hips relative to hands. An average and standard deviation of relative hip drop initiation and cessation were obtained by using the "average" and "stdev" functions in excel. 

Once the time points were all recorded, they were formatted to sync to the force plate data so they could be plotted together, as demonstrated in the following photo.

Data from each participant was collated onto another excel workbook as seen [here](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvXJ6M2Wl3faglZQZQNzFrcqIG9f). This workbook has multiple different sheets, the first sheet summarizes the force, power, and anthropometric data. On the second sheet, bar graphs were created to demonstrate differences between participants and trials for hip drop initiation, hip drop cessation, mean power, F<sub>z</sub> impulse per cycle, and F<sub>y</sub> impulse per cycle. These can also be seen below. To accurately compare impulse values between speeds and individuals, they were normalized by body weight and cycles completed per trial. The mean power was also normalized to body weight, these were both completed on the first sheet of the second excel workbook.
