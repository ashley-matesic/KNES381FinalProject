For this project, Excel was used to keep track of the key time points obtained during video analysis. This can be seen on a sample spread sheet of a participant, follow along [here](https://uofc-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ashley_matesic_ucalgary_ca/Ec1sPI2BVBlJshaKqP8PT_QB-jm_y-azlrx6ETv70nkPNQ?e=G5VcWx) (this link expires April 10th). The relative initiation of hip drop to hand drop was calculated for each cycle by subtracting hand drop time from the hip drop time, the same was performed for cessation of hips relative to hands. An average and standard deviation of relative hip drop initaion and cessation were obtained by using the "average" and "stdev" function in excel. 

Once the time points were all recorded, they were formatted to sync to the force plate data so they could be plotted together, as demonstartedin the following photo.

Data from each participant was collated onto another excel workbook as seen [here](https://uofc-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ashley_matesic_ucalgary_ca/Ecz5WH_LqcRCs3IP3BPg1PcBmIZ4JHAA3Qd4cGoMlQmIBA?e=zGAK6a) (link expires April 10th). This workbook has multiple different sheets, the first sheet summarizes the force, power and anthropometric data. On the second sheet, bar graphs were created to demonstrate differences between participants and trials for hip drop initaion, hip drop cessation, mean power per kg of body weight, normal force impulse per cycle per kg of body weight and parallel force impusle per cycle per kg of body weight. These can also be seen below. To accurately compare impusle values between speeds and individuals, they were normalized by body weight and cycles completed per trial. The mean power was also normalized to body weight, these were both completed on the first sheet of the second excel workbook.
